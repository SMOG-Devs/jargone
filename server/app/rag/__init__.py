"""
RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate text based on a given prompt.

The RAG process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Retrieval**:
   - Search the vector database for the most relevant chunks of text that match the user's query.
   - Use a similarity search algorithm to find the most relevant chunks.

2. **Generation**:
   - Use the LLM to generate a response based on the retrieved chunks and the user's query.
   - The LLM uses the retrieved chunks as context to generate a response.

3. **Output**:
   - The generated response is returned to the user.
